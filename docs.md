This project was based in the following tutorials of structural directives in **Angular**:

1. [Structural Directives in medium page](https://medium.com/angular-chile/directivas-estructurales-en-angular-33529aa9dd31).
2. [Structural Directives in angular page](https://angular.io/guide/structural-directives).
3. [Structural Directives in angular v2 archive](https://v2.angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/structural-directives.html).
4. [Structural Directives in Code Craft](https://codecraft.tv/courses/angular/built-in-directives/structural-directives/).

Also, we were able to create this project with the topics that we've already been seeing in the class meetings with the professor Yaneth Mej√≠a.
